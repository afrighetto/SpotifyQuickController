### Spotify Quick Controller
----

Written using ApplescriptObjC, with this nice, simple and useful controller, based on a friendly window, you can perform the main tasks more quickly leaving Spotify unopen, especially if you're used to listening to the usual stuff (while working for instance). <br />
And let's say you enjoy to play back the same 3-4 playlists very often: you can then save these ones and customize the change playlist pop-up button.
